                <h2>Welcome !</h2>
                <p>I am Ida Caspary, an Imperial College London Master's Student. I study Applied Computational Science and Engineering. This adds to my Computer Science Bachelor's and plenty of mchine learning research projects.
                </p>
                <p>My passion is <a href="IMI.html" target="_blank">mechanistic interpretability</a> - I want to help reaching safe AI</p>
                <p>My largest interests do also include innovative machine learning application, robotics, crpytography (homomorphic encryption! highly interesting).</p>
